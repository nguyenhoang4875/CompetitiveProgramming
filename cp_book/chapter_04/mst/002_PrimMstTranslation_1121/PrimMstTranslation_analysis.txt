PROBLEM SUMMARY:
- Task: Translate book from English to n target languages via translators
- Priority: Minimize translation distance from English, then minimize total cost
- Constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ m ≤ 4500, costs fit in 32-bit int
- Time/Space: [Required complexity]
    O((V + E) log V)

KEY IDEAS:
- MST problem with English as root node
- Prim's algorithm naturally minimizes distance first and cost from source while building MST
- Graph: languages are nodes, translator costs are edges

APPROACH:
1. Build graph with English + all target languages as nodes, bidirectional edges for translators
2. Run Prim's MST starting from "English"
3. If MST connects all n+1 nodes, output total cost; otherwise "Impossible"

EDGE CASES:
- Unreachable target languages → "Impossible"
- No translators but n > 0 → "Impossible"
