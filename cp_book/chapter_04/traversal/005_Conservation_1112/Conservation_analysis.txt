PROBLEM SUMMARY:
- Task: [Short task description]
    cho n, m: n: number of task, m: t1 t2: t2 is depended t1
    array a with n element each a[i] is room of task i (a[i] can be 1 or 2)
    m line: ech line contain t1 t2

    Find minimum number room to finish all task 

    // can start at 1 or 2:

- Constraints: [Important limits]
    1 <= n <= 1e5
    1 <= m <= 1e6
- Time/Space: [Required complexity]
    O(n + m)

KEY IDEAS:
- [Key idea 1]
    topo bfs with modification
    try to start at each room:
        for each room: run topo until the task in that room is empty and switch the room
        repeat until the task in both room is empty
    

- [Key idea 2]

APPROACH:
- [Algorithm or method]
- [Main steps]

EDGE CASES:
- [Special cases to watch for]
