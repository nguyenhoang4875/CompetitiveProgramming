# Mo's Algorithm

Mo's Algorithm, also known as the **Offline Query Processing** algorithm, is a technique used to efficiently process offline range queries or modifications in a sequence. This algorithm is particularly useful when the queries involve ranges or segments of the sequence. The key idea is to sort the queries based on some criteria and then process them in a way that avoids redundant work.

Here are the basic steps of Mo's Algorithm:

## Sort the Queries:
The queries are sorted in such a way that they can be processed efficiently.

## Initialize Data Structures:
Initialize any necessary data structures based on the problem requirements.

## Define the Block Size:
Divide the sequence into blocks of a certain size. The block size should be chosen based on the problem constraints to balance the trade-off between query processing time and the number of blocks.

## Process Queries:
Process the queries one block at a time.
Within each block, sort the queries based on their endpoint values.
Process the queries in the sorted order. While processing, try to minimize the work needed by reusing results from the previous queries within the same block.

## Finalize Results:

Combine the results obtained from processing each block to obtain the final result.
The efficiency of Mo's Algorithm comes from the fact that the sorted order of the queries and the use of blocks allow for reusing the results of previous queries within the same block, reducing redundant computations.
