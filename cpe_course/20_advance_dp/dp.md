# Dynamic Programming

## Steps
1. Form a state -> $f(x, y, z, ...)$
2. Forming a recursive relation
    - Base case
    - Optimal substructure
3. Overlapping subproblem: Tabulation or Memorization
    - Tabulation:
      - Fixed size
      - Not go to any state twice
    - Memorization:
      - Saving and reusing
      - Memo pad
