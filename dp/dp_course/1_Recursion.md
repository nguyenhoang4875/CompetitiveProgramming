# Recursion

Example:
We can define the operation "Go to Home" as:

**Base Case:**
    - if you are at home, stop moving

**Recursive Case:**
    - Take on step toward home.
    - Go to home

**Recursion = Principal of Mathematical Induction**

1. Figure of the Smallest Case
2. Alway Assume the Subproblem Can be Solved
3. Solve the current problem assuming subproblem solution exists
