# Introduction Dynamic Programming

Steps:
1. Form a state => $f(x, y, z)$
2. Forming a recursion relation
   - Optimal structure
3. Overlapping sub problems
Tabulation vs Memorization
- Tabulation: 
   - fixed size, static
   - not go to any state twice

- Memorization:
   - saving and reusing
   - memo pad

**DP = Recursion + Optimization**
